The Web Maps for WordPress plugin (aka. WebMaps for Wordpress) integrates the power of “where” into your pages and posts with interactive maps exposing authoritative content. Web Maps is designed to bridge the gap between authoritative maps registered with ArcGIS Online and WordPress (the most widely used CMS on the market). Note, you are not required to have an ArcGIS Online account to use/take advantage of this plugin, however, for users that do, you can use your org's AGOL content within the plug-in, making it even more powerful!

== Description ==
Quickly and easily search and add interactive maps to your pages and posts with the "Add Web Map / App", "ArcGIS Content Tree", and "Add Content Slideshow" blocks. All of the features previously found in the Web Maps for WordPress Pro plugin are now integrated into this plugin for free!
